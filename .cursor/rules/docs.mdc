## Documentation Generated by AI Agents

The `.ia` directory is reserved for documents generated automatically by AI agents. All automatically generated documentation files must be placed in this directory to maintain organization and distinguish between human-authored and AI-generated content.

**IMPORTANT - Documentation Placement**: If documentation is explicitly requested by the user, it must be placed in the `doc` directory instead of `.ia`. The `doc` directory is for user-requested documentation, while `.ia` is for automatically generated internal documentation.

## Environment Variables Management

**IMPORTANT - Environment Variables Management**: If environment variables need to be added or modified in the `.env` file:

- First modify the `.env.example` file (or create it if it doesn't exist) with the new variables
- Ask the user to copy these variables into their local `.env` file
- Never modify the `.env` file directly (it is usually in .gitignore)
- Document in the notes which variables have been added and must be configured by the user
